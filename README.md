## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- BEM methodology
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox
- Grid
- JavaScript
- Intersection Observer API
- Clipboard API
- Shrtcode API

### What I learned

This was my first more complex project with SCSS. Building the structure with a 7-1 pattern really helped with any code modyfications. In a future I would like to further explore possibilities of SCSS to write more maintainable and DRY code.

This challange was great for practicing fetching and handling data from 3rd party API.
